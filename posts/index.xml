      <description>Hi there.
My name is Alloysius Goh. I am a student in Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Singapore, studying Information Security &amp;amp; Forensics.
So why have I created this blog like thing? I do not know actually.
Maybe I want to document some of the things I find interesting? Maybe document some experiences from my journey so that I can look back? Or maybe I just want a place to pen my thoughts and rant about stuff.</description>
