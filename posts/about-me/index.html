      <p>Hi there.</p>

<p>My name is Alloysius Goh. I am a student in Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Singapore, studying Information Security &amp; Forensics.</p>

<p>So why have I created this blog like thing? I do not know actually.</p>

<p>Maybe I want to document some of the things I find interesting? Maybe document some experiences from my journey so that I can look back?
Or maybe I just want a place to pen my thoughts and rant about stuff.</p>

<p><em>So just a little more about who I am.</em></p>

<p>I am kinda a nerd hahaha</p>

<p>I like reading about things going on in the CyberSec world and I enjoy learning more about Security.</p>

<p>This journey started off back when I was in Secondary School. Just as most aspiring hackers, I was drawn by a film where some brilliant mind broke into a computer with some speed typing. Just as the bright green words &ldquo;ACCESS GRANTED&rdquo; was shown on the screen, I knew I wanted to do something like that. I tried entering my current school and course through an application exercise called the Early Admission Exercise (EAE) but I was not even called up for an interview.</p>

<p>But that did not kill my interest off. I told myself that I will make it in somehow. And so began my streak of studying for my exams. I swear that I have <strong>never</strong> studied so hard in my life. I knew I wanted it and I had to get it. I eventually got in and here I am in my third year, feeling exhausted and beat down by the sheer amount of work I have to do. Deadines after deadlines is actually driving me insane. I really want a break from everything and go back to the time where I can just play basketball with my friends all day long, no stress, no pressure, a lot happier.</p>

<p>I think this is enough depression for a post.</p>

<p>On another note, I hope that this site will be maintained and that I will continue writing about my experiences so that I will have something to look back on.</p>
